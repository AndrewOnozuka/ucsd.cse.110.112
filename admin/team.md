## About the Team Brand

![Powellpoint Pundits logo](branding/PowellPointPundits.png)
Since Powell doesn't go a lecture without mentioning soccer in his slides, 
our brand is based around a pun of "Powell" and "Powerpoint",
and the brand image is a Powerpoint themed soccer ball.
## Our Values

Teamwork, Communication, Hardwork, and Fun!
