## 2. Primary Means of Communication and Expectations

**Primary Method of Communication**  
Slack  

**Communication Expectations**  
- Keep slack notifications on. Respond to messages or react to them in no more than 12 hours.
- Communicate if something comes up. Stuff happens, but try to let everyone know when it does.
- Aim for at least a 24-hour notice for meetings: if the notice is given, we can start on time and need not wait.
- Be respectful of all team members.
- Do in-person meetings whenever possible-- shorter meetings may warrant zoom, but longer coding sessions should typically be in-person.

## 3. Scheduling Meetings  
Weekly Meeting: Wednesdays, 3:00PM on Zoom  
**Any additional meetings will have a 24 hour notice.**

## 4. General Responsibilities for All Team Members

## 5. Specific Team Member Responsibilities/Deadlines 
Everybody will work on whatever is assigned according to their team roles, however depending on the projects we face, this may or may not be updated as to track team member’s responsibilities. The primary responsibility for each team member is to commit time that is commensurate with their assigned task. Moreover, fostering a positive team environment which includes supporting and encouraging other team members is an essential responsibility. 

## 6. Conflict Resolution
In the case of individual conflicts: Privately message a team leader or Malcolm. Team leaders and Malcolm will discuss the best path forward, and whether or not it needs to be addressed with the whole group. Respect each other regardless of disagreements.  

The following is taken from Powell’s syllabus, under Diversity and Inclusion:  

*“We are committed to fostering a learning environment for this course that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences and respects your identities (including race, ethnicity, heritage, gender, sex, class, sexuality, religion, ability, age, educational background, etc.).*

*We will honor and respect our classmates, abiding by the UCSD Principles of Community.”*

## 7. Expectations of Faculty and GTA’s
If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.
