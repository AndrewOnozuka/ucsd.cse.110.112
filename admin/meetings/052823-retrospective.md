- The team finished the CI/CD pipeline and ADR documentation ahead of schedule.
- There was a sense of urgency in completing essential tasks such as setting up the skeleton and connecting to the local database.
4. Timely Deliverables and Ahead of Schedule:
- Tasks were delegated effectively, resulting in on-time deliverables.
- According to the TA's assessment, the team is ahead of schedule.

Bad:
1. Task Coordination and Communication Challenges:
- Lack of coordination and clear task delegation within sub-teams.
- Difficulties in getting everyone together for meetings and uncertain communication channels.
- Need for better communication between smaller teams and overall team members.
2. Uncertainty and Confusion:
- Late realization of confusion regarding prompt structure and formatting.
- Personal confusion about utilizing CI/CD pipeline tools like Jest and JSDocs.
- Pending decision on prompt generation and ongoing implementation challenges.
3. Communication Improvement:
- In-person meetings were preferred for certain tasks but were lacking, affecting pace.
- Slack communication time lag hindered problem-solving and led to longer wait times.
- Overall need for improved communication beyond weekly meetings.
4. Clarity of Objectives and Progress:
- Lack of clarity and last-minute progress despite meeting deadlines.
- Improvement needed in articulating objectives and ensuring consistent progress.

# Mad Sad Glad

Mad:
1. Frustrations with bugs:
- Automatic timezone correction in JavaScript caused inconvenience while coding the horoscope selection feature.
- Limited proficiency in JavaScript led to frustration and a significant amount of time spent on debugging errors in the response system.
2. Frustration with Prompt Discussion:
- Some frustration arose from the discussion about how to write and deliver prompts to the user.
- The decision on prompt generation was not made, and we are running low on time as we approach the end of the quarter.
3. Assignment Clarity and Participation:
- Some team members haven't contributed much to the project, indicating a need for clearer assignment distribution and increased participation.

Sad:
1. Disagreement and Delay in Prompt Generation:
- The team has not reached an agreement on how to generate prompts, leading to prolonged discussions in the last meeting.
2. Disappointment with Missed Meeting:
- Personal disappointment due to being unable to attend the CI/CD pipeline meeting, resulting in a lack of understanding and implementation knowledge.
3. Complexity of Prompt Generation:
- Concerns about making the project overly complex by requiring different prompts for each session.
4. Desire for In-Person Collaboration:
- Challenges in getting the entire team together in person, which affects the bonding and personal touch that comes with in-person collaboration.

Glad:
1. Positive Progress and Team Satisfaction:
- The team is ahead of most others, including those who haven't started coding yet, which is a source of satisfaction.
- Gladness about personal contribution and the team's overall track record.
2. Effective Collaboration and Core Functionality:
- Early completion of tasks within the user input group and seeing the project come together.
- Successful setup of the sprint board and efficient use of issues, actions, and pull request linking.
- Strong performance in UI development and establishing the project's basic framework.
3. Productivity and Psychological Safety:
- Rapid achievement of core functionality and a responsive project.
- Appreciation for the team's psychological safety, consistent attendance, and individual accountability.
4. Communication and Progress:
- Positive outlook on discussing prompt writing and delivery, recognizing the importance of addressing it early.
- Excitement about the progress made, surpassing expectations and fostering encouragement.

# Takeaways

1. Importance of Organization and Planning:
- Acknowledgment of the need for organization and planning within a team.
- Lack of a schedule for the product, resulting in a somewhat improvisational approach.
2. Emphasis on Coordination and Timely Actions:
- Highlighting the significance of coordinating tasks and responsibilities.
- Recommending early establishment of meeting times and prompt delegation for efficient workflow.
3. Encouraging Communication and Collaboration:
- Recognizing the importance of increased communication within the team.
- Encouraging team members to ask questions, share ideas, and provide input for more complex aspects of the project.
4. Focus on Productive Processes and Results:
- Understanding that effective processes lead to better outcomes.
- Recognizing the value of sustained good practices and motivated team members.
- Overall satisfaction with the team's progress, while acknowledging the need for improved communication and active participation.

From some of the contradictions in the good vs bad section above, we can see very clearly that although we were able to successfully delegate tasks and hit our timelines, it was not always done with a clear and shared understanding between members of the team. There are times where things are last minute and while some teams were able to coordinate well, others could not say the same. We finished our CI/CD pipeline, but the tools involved and what they are utilized for was not clearly communicated to all members, which leads to bad code maintainability. This is something we can fix through more in person meetings, as well as through our intro video which will go over everything we have done, which should help us all get back on the same page with oneanother.

# Next Steps

1. Focus on Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
- Priority placed on completing the minimum viable product.
- Aim to have a functional and working prototype.
2. Emphasis on Organization and Communication:
- Recognizing the need to organize tasks and improve communication within the team.
- Open communication and sharing of ideas, particularly regarding design features and more complex aspects of the project.
3. Key Functionality and Interlinking of Parts:
- Importance of ensuring proper interlinking of different components, such as horoscopes populating the sidebar.
- Highlighting the significance of getting essential functionality in place.
4. Prioritizing Key Aspects and Iterative Development:
- Focus on prioritizing "ilities" (non-functional requirements) and cleaning up the code base.
- Planning to implement additional features only if they enhance the user experience.
- Next steps include CI/CD processes, remembering past horoscopes, and making side profiles functional.

Our next steps include deciding how to generate the prompts for our JSON database, as well as how to reasonably push deadlines so that everyone can work in a timely manner. One way to encourage greater bursts of progress would be through more in person meetings, especially among sub teams. These are things we are looking to implement as we begin our second sprint and look to finish a MVP by the end of week 9.
