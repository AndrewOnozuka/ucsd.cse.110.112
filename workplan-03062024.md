- Group Overall Thoughts on Minal
  - We felt as though it went well
  - It was a fun format the involved strong collaboration and teamwork (we would recommend for future classes)
  - Maybe give a little more structure regarding where students can pull information from
  - Provide more time for feedback on questions
 
#### Back To The Project
- Frontend/Design Team:
  - UI/UX Consistency fixes have been made and a PR has been created
  - The page for daily horoscopes has been made and hooked up to the backend function. A PR has also been created for that
- Backend Team:
  - Working on getting the love compatibility page out and PR'd next week
  - Looking into how we can fix the bugged mp4 for animation
  - Start investigating if it is possible to set up some sort of share to social media with the horoscopes
- Testing Team:
  - Looks like some tests broke when we split up the application into multiple pages
  - We want to get this fixed before we submit more PRs
 
#### Starting To Wrap Up
- Goals For Next week:
  - Get our features completed, reviewed, and merged
  - Make sure all of the documentation we have created has been moved to GitHub where it is public for viewers
  - Make sure Project Board is all cleaned up
  - If time, we will try to squeeze in a few small features
